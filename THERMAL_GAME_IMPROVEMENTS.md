# Thermal Game Challenge Improvements

This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to make the thermal simulation game significantly more challenging and engaging. The changes transform the game from "doing nothing works fine" to "active management required."

## 🎯 Overview of Changes

The improvements address 6 key areas to create a more challenging and realistic thermal management game:

1. **Faster Drift & Tighter Margins** - Building loses heat much faster
2. **Dynamic Infiltration** - Wind and window events affect heat loss
3. **HVAC Realism** - Limited power, ramp constraints, and defrost penalties  
4. **Tighter Comfort** - Stricter temperature tolerance with complaint penalties
5. **Mean Disturbances** - Random events that disrupt steady-state operation
6. **Difficulty Presets** - Easy/Normal/Hard modes for different challenge levels

## 🏠 1. Building Thermal Changes (Faster Drift)

### Key Parameter Updates
```python
# OLD vs NEW default values:
Ci_kwh_per_K: 2.0      # (was 3.0) - lighter air mass → faster response  
Ce_kwh_per_K: 12.0     # (was 35.0) - lighter envelope → shorter thermal memory
Rie_degC_per_kW: 8.0   # (was 10.0) - tighter air↔envelope coupling
Rea_degC_per_kW: 10.0  # (was 8.0) - more loss to ambient through walls  
Ria_degC_per_kW: 15.0  # (unchanged) - leakier infiltration
```

### Impact
- **Time constant reduced** from ~45 hours to ~10 hours (Normal mode)
- **Drift rate increased** to ~0.3-0.6°C per 15 minutes at ΔT=10K
- **"Doing nothing" no longer viable** - temperature drops 5°C in 24 hours without heating

## 🌬️ 2. Dynamic Infiltration Model

### New Features
- **Wind-driven leakage**: `ACH = base + wind_speed * 0.35`
- **Window events**: Occasional opening (0.2-0.5 fraction) for 2-4 steps
- **Thermal bridges**: Envelope conductance multiplied by 1.25 factor

### Parameters
```python
house_volume_m3: 250.0           # Typical small house
ach_base: 0.5                    # Base air changes per hour
ach_per_mps: 0.35               # Wind-driven ACH slope  
window_ach_at_full_open: 6.0    # Extra ACH when windows open
bridge_factor: 1.25             # Thermal bridge multiplier
```

### Impact
- **Variable heat loss** based on weather conditions
- **Unpredictable spikes** in heating/cooling demand
- **Realistic building physics** with wind and infiltration effects

## ⚡ 3. HVAC System Realism

### Power & Authority Limits
```python
hvac_size_kw: 2.6              # Reduced from 3.0 kW (Normal mode)
hvac_ramp_kw_per_step: 0.5     # Can't slam to full power instantly
batt_c_rate: 0.4               # Battery can't fully mask HVAC peaks
```

### Defrost Penalties (Heat Pumps)
When outdoor temperature < 2°C:
- **COP reduced** by 30% (`cop * 0.7`)
- **Capacity reduced** by 20% (`max_power * 0.8`)

### Impact
- **Can't instantly respond** to temperature changes
- **Reduced efficiency** in cold weather (realistic heat pump behavior)
- **Strategic pre-heating/cooling** becomes necessary

## 🎯 4. Comfort Requirements

### Tighter Tolerance Bands
```python
# Occupied homes:
comfort_tolerance_occupied_C: 0.5    # ±0.5°C (was ±1.0°C)

# Unoccupied homes:  
comfort_tolerance_unoccupied_C: 1.0  # ±1.0°C (unchanged)
```

### Enhanced Penalty System
```python
comfort_weight: 1.5                  # Increased from 0.5 (3x penalty)
complaint_threshold_C: 1.0           # Complaints if >1°C off target
complaint_penalty_per_step: 1.0      # Extra penalty per complaint step
complaint_duration_threshold: 2      # Complaints after 2 consecutive bad steps
```

### Impact
- **Precision control required** to maintain ±0.5°C when occupied
- **Escalating penalties** for sustained discomfort
- **Comfort becomes expensive** if not managed properly

## 🎲 5. Disturbances & Realism

### Internal Gains Noise
- **Random variation** in internal heat gains when occupied
- **Standard deviation**: 0.2 kW (Gaussian noise)

### Solar Pops
- **Short bursts** of extra solar gains (0.5-1.5 kW for 3 steps)  
- **Triggered** on warm days (T_out > 5°C) with 10% probability

### Window Events  
- **Random opening** (0.2-0.5 fraction) with 2% probability per step
- **Duration**: 3 steps (45 minutes) 
- **Massive heat loss** when combined with wind

### Sensor Lag
- **Measurement filtering**: `T_measured = 0.7*T_prev + 0.3*T_actual`
- **Control overshoot** due to delayed temperature feedback

### Impact
- **No steady-state operation** - always something happening
- **Reactive control fails** - must anticipate disturbances  
- **Realistic sensor behavior** adds control challenge

## ⚙️ 6. Difficulty Presets

### Easy Mode (Almost Today's Building)
```python
Ci=3.0, Ce=20.0, Ria=60.0, Rea=20.0
τ ≈ 45 hours, no HVAC limits, no defrost penalty
```
- **Gentle drift**: ~2.5°C drop in 24 hours idle
- **Comfort penalty**: 66 points total
- **Suitable for learning** basic control concepts

### Normal Mode (Idling Fails)
```python  
Ci=2.0, Ce=12.0, Ria=15.0, Rea=10.0
τ ≈ 10 hours, ramp limits, defrost penalties
```
- **Aggressive drift**: ~5°C drop in 24 hours idle  
- **Comfort penalty**: 773 points total
- **Active control required** to maintain comfort

### Hard Mode (Must Pre-heat/Cool)
```python
Ci=1.5, Ce=10.0, Ria=10.0, Rea=8.0  
τ ≈ 5 hours, all constraints, bridge_factor=1.4
```
- **Extreme drift**: ~6°C drop in 24 hours idle
- **Comfort penalty**: 1418 points total  
- **Predictive control essential** for success

## 🎮 Gameplay Impact

### Before (Original)
- Doing nothing → minor drift, low penalties
- Simple bang-bang control → perfect comfort
- HVAC could instantly provide any needed power
- Steady-state operation most of the time

### After (Improved)
- **Doing nothing → rapid drift, high penalties** 
- **Proportional control → good comfort but high energy use**
- **HVAC constraints require planning and anticipation**
- **Constant disturbances prevent steady-state operation**

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Difficulty | Time Constant | 24h Drift | Total Penalty | Strategy Required |
|------------|--------------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Easy       | 45.0 hours   | 2.5°C     | 66 points     | Basic bang-bang   |
| Normal     | 10.4 hours   | 4.9°C     | 773 points    | Active control    |
| Hard       | 5.5 hours    | 6.2°C     | 1418 points   | Predictive control|

)
```

## 📈 Results

The improvements successfully transform the thermal game from passive to active:

1. **Challenge Achieved**: "Normal" mode makes idle operation impossible
2. **Realism Added**: HVAC constraints and disturbances require planning  
3. **Skill Rewarded**: Better control strategies significantly outperform simple ones
4. **Scalable Difficulty**: Easy→Normal→Hard provides learning progression
5. **Engagement**: Constant disturbances keep gameplay dynamic and interesting

The game now provides a genuine challenge that rewards skillful energy management while teaching real-world building physics and HVAC system constraints.
